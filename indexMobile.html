          <p class="About-text">I am Zlatina, but you can call me Tina. I am a marketing professional, passionate about <span style="color: #67AB5A">smart marketing, creative content, and effective communication</span> to make it all happen. In my
            work,
            I have seen the value of applying the creative process and utilizing the latest digital technologies to gain the most suitable outcomes for the stakeholder‚Äôs needs. <br> <br>
            Personally, I strive to always approach challenges with <span style="color: #67AB5A">a positive mindset and a critical eye</span>. Unleashing curiosity and encouraging critical thinking has proven to be beneficial to
            increasing customer engagement and lead generation in previous marketing projects and campaigns I have worked on.
            My past work and study experiences have helped me become highly adaptable to different environments and cultures, which in turn has made me a better collaborator.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a (sometimes) funny extrovert, I love traveling, meeting new people, and enjoying life. üòä
